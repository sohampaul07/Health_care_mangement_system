## 1. Problem Statement

Public healthcare systems across developing nations face chronic vulnerabilities in medicine supply chains, bed allocation, and workforce management. Conventional healthcare portals display only **historical or current snapshots** without predictive runway intelligence.

Consequently, Primary Health Centres (PHCs) experience:
- Sudden stock-outs of essential antibiotics, analgesics, ORS, and vaccines
- Severe inpatient bed shortages during acute seasonal epidemics
- Staffing imbalances with lack of situational awareness across districts
- Inefficient inter-district resource distribution where one facility experiences stock-outs while another holds surplus stock expiring in storage

---

## 2. Core Idea & Mission

**HEALTHSYNC AI** transitions public healthcare administration from **passive monitoring** to **anticipatory decision intelligence**. 

The command center integrates:
$$\text{Current Status} + \text{Historical Telemetry} + \text{Patient Footfall} + \text{Consumption Velocity} + \text{Inpatient Beds} + \text{Clinical Workforce} + \text{AI Forecasting} + \text{Early Warning} + \text{Redistribution} + \text{What-If Simulation} + \text{Federated AI}$$

It directly answers the 10 vital operational questions for health directors:
1. **What is happening now?** Live KPI dashboard across 12,540 PHCs.
2. **What is likely to happen next?** Multi-horizon demand regression (7, 30, and 90 days).
3. **Which PHCs are at risk?** Automated sorting by Composite Resource Risk Index.
4. **Which medicines may run out?** Critical runway countdowns ($<48\text{ hours}$).
5. **How many days remain before stock-out?** Exact decimal stock-out timelines ($2.7\text{ days}$).
6. **Which district has surplus resources?** Identification of donor hubs with $>21\text{ days}$ runway.
7. **Which district needs those resources?** Deficit matching without donor depletion.
8. **What redistribution does AI recommend?** Specific transfer volumes, routes, and confidence ratings.
9. **What happens if demand increases by 10%, 20%, 30%, or 50%?** Non-destructive What-If stress testing.
10. **How can distributed healthcare data contribute to shared predictive modeling?** Privacy-preserving Federated AI architecture.

## 7. Key Features & Innovations

1. **Predictive Runway Evaluation:** Calculates days until depletion using consumption velocity, patient surges, and therapeutic category trends.
2. **Autonomous Early Warnings:** Categorizes alerts into `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, and `LOW` with complete explainable evidence.
3. **Cross-District Rebalancing:** Matches surplus storage facilities with deficit outposts; transfers are executed only upon authorized officer confirmation.
4. **What-If Simulation Sandbox:** Allows planners to test $0\%$, $10\%$, $20\%$, $30\%$, and $50\%$ epidemiological demand surges in real time without mutating database records.
5. **Federated AI Demonstration:** Simulates privacy-preserving edge learning across 5 PHC nodes using Differential Privacy ($\varepsilon=1.2$) and FedAvg aggregation.
6. **BRICS Collaborative Architecture:** Demonstrates a conceptual shared predictive layer across India, Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa.
7. **Complete Governance & Auditability:** Immutable logging of all logins, stock changes, and redistribution approvals, with one-click CSV export.

## 10. Prototype & Demonstration Notice

> **IMPORTANT:**  
> This software is a working prototype developed for demonstration and hackathon evaluation. All hospital names, patient volumes, medicine balances, and federated parameters are **realistic fictional representations**. The platform does not connect to live government databases or transmit real patient records.
